## Data Science Projects

### Melody Recognition in Carnatic Music

[Click to see the project!](https://github.com/Shiviiii23/Carnatic-Music-ML/tree/main)
- For this project, I used **decision trees, random forests, and neural networks** and made a comparison between the three methods to see which algorithm would recognize the ragas the best. Finally, I used the **confusion matrix** to analyze my data and draw conclusions from that.

- This projects is one of my favorites as it combines both of my passions: Carnatic Music and Data Science! In Carnatic Music, there are specific "scales" of notes that musicians follow to render each piece, and sometimes the difference between each scale can be just one note! These scales are called ragas. Many times in concerts, music conoisseurs find themselves trying to recognize which raga is being rendered. I decided to let Machine Learning give it a try!
  

### Recommendation System for Writing Startup

[Click to see the project!](https://github.com/Shiviiii23/RecommendationEng/tree/master)

- I used **NLP** methods to create a custom recommendation engine for a startup that only had a few data points. Instead of using the popular methods for creating a recommendation engine, I had to devise a new way of doing so since there were only a few data points and a few user ratings. Instead of relying only on ratings, I used the writing samples data to my advantage, combined with the few user ratings to **match writing works that were similar to each other and also popularly recommended by users**.

- I also used **K-Nearest Neighbors** to make another recommendation engine with the same data. 

### Bike Data Analysis (Group Project)

- A group of students and I analyzed biker data as part of a class assignment to predict when a biker is most likely to have an accident. We used **data cleaning methods such as one-hot encoding and data deletion** to clean the data, then used different ML methods such as **decision trees and random forests** with different classifiers such as **AdaBoost and GridCV** to make a conclusions about which features led to bike crashes and which model gave us the most accurate results. 

## Research

### Pancreas Research

- I am currently working on this research to create an explainable AI model that can map the shape of a pancreas to the onset of type-1 diabetes. 

### Robot Arm Trajectory Segmentation 

- A group of students and I used **Neural Networks** to segment robot arm trajectories as a part of the UT Austin Freshman Research Initiative.
  
- In a separate project, a group of students and I used **regression** to have two robot arms build a burger from plastic burger ingredients.
  
## Coursework

### Data Mining
- Introduction to Data Mining:
    - Learned about basic data mining techniques such as **Regression, SVMs, Neural Networks, and Decision Trees** and **implemented each algorithm from scratch**. The course ended with a final group project (bike project shown above).
      
 - Advanced Data Mining:
    - Delved into the mathematics behind Machine Learning methods and optimization.
  
### NLP 
- Learned basic NLP algorithms such as the **Viterbi algorithm** and implemented basic NLP techniques on simple text data. 

### Reinforcement Learning (Masters)
- In progress. Learning about Reinforcement Learning theory and applications (along with implementation).

### Case Studies in Machine Learning (Masters)
- In progress. Learning about and implementing different applications of Machine Learning methods. 

### Stochastic Processes
- Learned about stochastic processes and markov chains. 

### Applied Statistics/Applied Regression & Time Series
- Applied Statistics
    - Learned statistics and its applications to data.
 
- Applied Regression and Time Series
    - Delved into the mathematics behind regression and analyses/regression of time series data.
