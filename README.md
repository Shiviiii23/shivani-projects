## Data Science Projects

### Melody Recognition in Carnatic Music


[Click to see the project!](https://github.com/Shiviiii23/Carnatic-Music-ML/tree/main)
- This projects is one of my favorites as it combines both of my passions: Carnatic Music and Data Science! In Carnatic Music, there are specific "scales" of notes that musicians follow to render each piece, and sometimes the difference between each scale can be just half a note! These scales are called ragas. Many times in concerts, music conoisseurs find themselves trying to recognize which raga is being rendered. I decided to let Machine Learning give it a try! 
- For this project, I used **decision trees, random forests, and neural networks** and made a comparison between the three methods to see which algorithm would recognize the ragas the best. Finally, I used the **confusion matrix** to analyze my data and drew conclusions from that.
